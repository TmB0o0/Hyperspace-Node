1.  Visit [https://node.hyper.space/](https://node.hyper.space/) .
    
2.  **Enable Browser node** : On the home screen of the website, you will see a switch (located under the key icon in the upper left corner). Click it to enable the browser node.
    
3.  After the browser node is powered on, click the key icon.
    
4. Now click **"COPY CURRENT PRIVATE KEY‚Äù** . This will copy the private key to the clipboard.
    
5.  Save this key in a safe place, as you will need to paste it into the `.pem` file during the installation process.

```bash
curl -sL -o hyperspace https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TmB0o0/Hyperspace-Node/refs/heads/main/hyperspace

```
-   **Installation Process**: The script will add the necessary models, ask you to create a `.pem` file for the private key, and complete the setup by selecting tiers.

-   **Update Node**: This will show the current version of your node using the `aios-cli version` command.
    
-   **Show Logs**: This connects to the screen session named `hyperspace` and shows the logs from the running process. If the session isn't found, it will notify you.
    
    **Note**: If you need to detach from the screen session, press `Ctrl + A`, then `D`.
    
-   **Uninstall Node**: This will prompt for confirmation to uninstall the node. If confirmed, the node will be removed using the uninstall command.

### Common Issues üöß

-   **Illegal instruction (core dumped)**:
    
    -   This error usually happens due to insufficient cores or an incompatible kernel. To resolve this, it's recommended to use a more powerful server with the necessary system specifications (especially for CPU and RAM).
